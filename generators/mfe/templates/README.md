# Introduction

This application is a micro-frontend hosted by the [wrapper micro-frontend](https://www.notion.so/lucascoalves/Environments-63d07a3dabc94d34b05412aec6ddad77).

If you would like to understand this approach a little bit more, you can take a look [here](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html)

## Getting Started

### 1. Recommended plugins for VSCode

- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode

### 2. Setup

1. [Install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) **Note:** version ^10.16
2. [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
3. [Set up your client's npmrc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/npm/npmrc?view=azure-devops&tabs=windows)  
   Make sure you choose `customer-portal-shared-services` in the combobox, before connect `.npmrc`
4. Run this command on root folder to install our git hooks:  
   `make hooks`
5. Run this command on `src` to download all dependencies:  
   `yarn install`

### 3. Run and build the application

1. Run this command **on root** folder to build the app:  
   `make build`
2. Run this command on root folder to run on dev environment:  
   `make run-dev`
3. Run this command to run our mocks on dev environment:  
   `make dev-dependencies`

### 4. Automated tests

1. To run unit tests:  
   `yarn test`
2. To see the code coverage  
   `yarn coverage`
3. To run the component-test  
   `make component-tests-dev`
4. To run the component tests on CLI mode  
   `make component-tests`

### 5. SCM

1. We must use [Trunk-based Development](https://www.notion.so/lucascoalves/SCM-Process-3f504c989798407496ea6c9873f68f7e) on this repo
2. The commit messages should follow this pattern:  
   `[AZUREID-123][AZUREID-456] Message describing your changes`  
    The first information ([AZUREID-123]) is the story key on Azure and the second one ([AZUREID-456]) is the key of the sub-task on Azure.  
    If the commit message is not on the pattern above, the hooks will block the commit

### 6. Best practices

1. [Customer portal guide](https://www.notion.so/lucascoalves/React-code-standards-e9d47b604ce74e19927b6c8c4d32d8d5)

### 7. Metrics

1. [Sonar](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=<%= normalizedMfeName %>)
2. We expect 100% of code coverage and that is validated on our pre-commit hook
